Bank tech test
Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time. This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.
